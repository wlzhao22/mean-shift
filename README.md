# mean-shift

### Introduction

Implementation according to Comaniciu, D., etc paper:

 "Mean Shift: A Robust Approach Toward Feature Space Analysis".
 in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE) 24 (5): 603â€“619

 This is part of my work during my graduate study in Yunnan University as an MPhil, China from 2003 to 2004.
 
 
 ### Compile and Run
 This project can be compiled smoothly on Linux and MacOS with GCC 4.0 or higher. The 'libjpeg' is required. The user can find the libjpeg from my another project "lip-vireo".
 Just compile the "jpeg" library and copy "libjpeg.a" to folder "lib/". Then run following commands.
 
 ```
 cd mean-shift
 make release
 ```
