# mean-shift

### Introduction

Implementation according to Comaniciu, D., etc paper:

 "Mean Shift: A Robust Approach Toward Feature Space Analysis".
 in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE) 24 (5): 603â€“619

 This is part of my work during my graduate study in Yunnan University as an MPhil, China from 2003 to 2004.
 
 
 ### Compile and Run
 This project can be compiled smoothly on Linux and MacOS with GCC 4.0 or higher. The 'libjpeg' is required. The user can find the libjpeg from my another project "lip-vireo".
 Just compile the "jpeg" library and copy "libjpeg.a" to folder "lib/". Then run following commands.
 
 ```
 cd mean-shift
 make release
 ```
 
 ### History
This project was first implemented by Wan-Lei zhao during his gradudate study (2004-2005). There were many discussions about this algorithm with my junior and good friend Yang Zhao at that time. Wan-Lei Zhao keeps these codes with him all the way, and share them joyfully to you now. Wish you can have similar funs as him.
